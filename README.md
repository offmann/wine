# Wine quality prediction
Modelling a Kaggle dataset of [red wine properties and quality ratings](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009). 

I'm going to use CML in this repo

What is CML? Continuous Machine Learning (CML) is an open-source CLI tool for implementing continuous integration & delivery (CI/CD) with a focus on MLOps. Use it to automate development workflows — including machine provisioning, model training and evaluation, comparing ML experiments across project history, and monitoring changing datasets.

CML can help train and evaluate models — and then generate a visual report with results and metrics — automatically on every pull request.

Please refer to github actions to see the cml work
